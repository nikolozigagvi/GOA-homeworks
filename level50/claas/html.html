        <p>i dont know if i have ever had so much fun in my own town. i mean, on  vacation
             this kind of fun is understandable. but at home? where i work and maintain friendships 
            and pay bills? i had no idea life could be this good. yesterday brian 
            and i did nothing but play. i ditched work all day. guiltily answering my phone, fearing 
            it would be some authority figure to get me in trouble, until brian 
            told me to just leave it behind. then it was off to the creek, where there's nothing to
             fear but rope-swings and beer.</p>
