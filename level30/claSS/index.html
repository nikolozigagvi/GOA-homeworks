<p style="color: gold; border: 2em; box-sizing: border-box; bottom: right; background-color: black;">Gabrielle Essence by Chanel is a Floral Woody Musk fragrance for women. Gabrielle Essence was launched in 2019. The nose behind this fragrance is Olivier Polge. Top notes are Citruses, Peach, Red Fruits, Black Currant and Petitgrain; middle notes are White Flowers, Tuberose, Ylang-Ylang, Jasmine, Orange Blossom and Coconut; base notes are Musk, Sandalwood and Vanilla
    The bold, independent character of Gabrielle Chanel would determine her fate and change the course of history. In 2017, CHANEL created a fragrance in her honor, a reflection of her extraordinary, determined and passionate spirit: GABRIELLE CHANEL. From the scent to the bottle—both firsts in the history of CHANEL—and the choice of name, it pays tribute to the woman she was before Coco Chanel.
    In 2019, GABRIELLE CHANEL Eau de Parfum is reinvented with GABRIELLE CHANEL ESSENCE. Familiar but unlike no other, this new olfactory variation shows a more vibrant and opulent
    Inspired by the very essence of Gabrielles radiance, the fragrance shines with intensity, inviting all women reveal their true selves, to follow their instincts by expressing their freedom and speaking their mind. The voluptuous scent works its magic to reveal each individual identity. Solar, it heightens the dazzling charisma of the woman who wears it with warmth and luminosity.</p>
